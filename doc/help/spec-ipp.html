<H1 CLASS="title">CUPS Implementation of IPP</H1>

<h2 class='title'><a name='INTRODUCTION'>Introduction</a></h2>

<p>CUPS implements IPP/2.1 and the operations and attributes
defined in the "IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations", "IPP/1.1:
Output-bin Attribute Extension", and "IPP/1.1: finishings
'fold',' trim', and 'bale' attribute values extension"
specifications.</p>

<p>CUPS also provides 16 new operations and many new attributes
to support multiple IPP printers and printer classes on a single
host.</p>

<h3 class='title'><a name='IPP_URIS'>IPP URIs</a></h3>

<p>CUPS supports the "http", "https", and "ipp" schemes. The
following resource names are used:</p>

<dl>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/</tt></dt>

	<dd>Can be used for all "get" operations and for server
	subscriptions.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/admin/</tt></dt>

	<dd>Used for all administrative operations.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/classes/name</tt></dt>

	<dd>Specifies a printer class.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/jobs/id</tt></dt>

	<dd>Specifies a job.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/printers/name</tt></dt>

	<dd>Specifies a printer.</dd>

</dl>

<p>So a typical printer URI would be
"ipp://foo.bar.com/printers/LaserJet". In addition, the CUPS
server also supports normal browser access via
"http://hostname:port/" and "https://hostname:port/".</p>

<h3 class='title'><a name='IPP_OPERATIONS'>CUPS IPP Operations</a></h3>

<p>CUPS provides 16 extension operations in addition to most of the
standard IPP and registered extension operations:

<h2 class='title'><a name='ATTRIBUTES'>Attributes</a></h2>

<p>CUPS provides many extension attributes to support multiple
devices, PPD files, standard job filters, printers, and printer
classes.</p>

<h3 class='title'><a name='DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES'>Device Attributes</a></h3>

<p>Device attributes are returned by the CUPS-Get-Devices
operation and enumerate all of the available hardware devices and
network protocols that are supported by the server.</p>

<h4><a name="device-class">device-class (type2 keyword)</a></h4>

<p>The device-class attribute specifies the class of device and can be
one of the following:

<ul>

	<li>"file" - a disk file.

	<li>"direct" - a parallel or fixed-rate serial data port,
	currently used for Centronics, IEEE-1284, and USB printer
	ports.

	<li>"serial" - a variable-rate serial port.

	<li>"network" - a network connection, typically via AppSocket,
	HTTP, IPP, LPD, or SMB/CIFS protocols.

</ul>

<h4><a name="device-id">device-id (text(127))</a><span class="info">CUPS 1.2/OS X 10.5</span></h4>

<p>The device-id attribute specifies the IEEE-1284 device ID
string for the device.</p>

<h4><a name="device-info">device-info (text(127))</a></h4>

<p>The device-info attribute specifies a human-readable string describing
the device, e.g. "Parallel Port #1".

<h4><a name="device-location">device-location (text(127))</a><span class="info">CUPS 1.4/OS X 10.6</span></h4>

<p>The device-location attribute specifies the physical location of the
printer.

<h4><a name="device-make-and-model">device-make-and-model (text(127))</a></h4>

<p>The device-make-and-model attribute specifies a device
identification string provided by the printer connected to the device.
If the device or printer does not support identification then this
attribute contains the string "unknown".

<h4><a name="device-uri">device-uri (uri)</a></h4>

<p>The device-uri attribute specifies a unique identifier for the
device. The actual format of the device-uri string depends on the value
of the device-class attribute:

<ul>

	<li>"file" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"file:///path/to/filename".

	<li>"direct" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"scheme:/dev/filename" or "scheme://vendor/identifier",
	where scheme may be "parallel" or "usb" in the current
	implementation.

	<li>"serial" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"serial:/dev/filename?baud=value+parity=value+flow=value".
	The baud value is the data rate in bits per second; the
	supported values depend on the underlying hardware.
	The parity value can be one of "none", "even", or "odd".
	The flow value can be one of "none", "soft" (XON/XOFF
	handshaking), "hard" or "rts/cts" (RTS/CTS handshaking),
	or "dtrdsr" (DTR/DSR handshaking).

	<p>The URI returned by CUPS-Get-Devices will contain the
	maximum baud rate supported by the device and the best
	type of flow control available ("soft" or "hard").

	<li>"network" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"scheme://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/[resource]",
	where scheme may be "http", "https", "ipp", "lpd", "smb", or
	"socket" in the current implementation.

	<p>The URI returned by CUPS-Get-Devices will only contain
	the scheme name ("scheme"). It is up to the client
	application to add the appropriate host and other
	information when adding a new printer.

	<p>The URI returned by Get-Printer-Attributes and
	CUPS-Get-Printers has any username and password information
	stripped; the information is still stored and used by the
	server internally to perform any needed authentication.

</ul>

<h4><a name="port-monitor">port-monitor" (name(127))</a></h4>

<p>The port-monitor attribute specifies the port monitor to use when printing
to this printer. The default port monitor is "none".

<h4><a name="port-monitor-supported">port-monitor-supported" (1setOf name(127))</a></h4>

<p>The port-monitor-supported attribute specifies the available port monitors.

<h4><a name="printer-commands">printer-commands (1setOf Type3 keyword)</a><span class='info'>CUPS 1.4/OS X 10.6</span></h4>

<p>The printer-commands attribute specifies the commands that are supported
by the CUPS command file filter. The keyword "none" indicates that no commands
are supported.</p>

<h4><a name="printer-dns-sd-name">printer-dns-sd-name (name(MAX) | noValue)</a><span class='info'>CUPS 1.4/OS X 10.6</span></h4>

<p>The printer-dns-sd-name attribute specifies the registered DNS-SD service
name for the printer. If the printer is not being shared using this protocol,
printer-dns-sd-name will have the noValue value.</p>

<h4><a name="printer-state-reasons">printer-state-reasons (1setOf type2 keyword)</a></h4>

<p>The printer-state-reasons attribute provides additional persistent state
information for a printer. In addition to the keywords defined in RFC 2911,
CUPS supports vendor-specific keywords with a domain prefix ("com.vendor.foo")
and the following CUPS-specific keywords:</p>

<ul>

	<li><tt>cups-insecure-filter-warning</tt> - a filter or backend (or the
	directory containing the filter or backend) has insecure file
	permissions. CUPS will not execute programs with world write permissions
	or setuid programs. When run as root (the default), CUPS also does not
	execute programs that are not owned by root.
	<span class='info'>CUPS 1.4/OS X 10.6</span></li>

	<li><tt>cups-missing-filter-warning</tt> - a filter or backend is not
	installed. <span class='info'>CUPS 1.4/OS X 10.6</span></li>

</ul>

<h4><a name="printer-type">printer-type (type2 enum)</a></h4>

<p>The printer-type attribute specifies printer type and
capability bits for the printer or class. The default value is
computed from internal state information and the PPD file for the
printer. The following bits are defined:</p>

<h4>printer-type-mask (type2 enum)<span class='info'>CUPS 1.1</span></h4>

<p>The printer-type-mask attribute is used to choose printers or classes with
the CUPS-Get-Printers and CUPS-Get-Classes operations. The bits are defined
identically to the printer-type attribute and default to all 1's.

<h4>requesting-user-name-allowed (1setof name(127))<span class='info'>CUPS 1.1</span></h4>

<p>The requesting-user-name-allowed attribute lists all of the users that are
allowed to access a printer or class. Either this attribute or the
requesting-user-name-denied attribute will be defined, but not both.

<h4>requesting-user-name-denied (1setof name(127))<span class='info'>CUPS 1.1</span></h4>

<p>The requesting-user-name-denied attribute lists all of the users that are
not allowed to access a printer or class. Either this attribute or the
requesting-user-name-allowed attribute will be defined, but not both.

<h3 class='title'><a name='CLASS_ATTRIBUTES'>Printer Class Attributes</a></h3>

<h4>member-names (1setof name(127))</h4>

<p>The member-names attribute specifies each of the printer-name attributes of
the member printers and classes. Each name corresponds to the same element of
the member-uris attribute.

<h4>member-uris (1setof uri)</h4>

<p>The member-uris attribute specifies each of the printer-uri attributes of
the member printers and classes. Each URI corresponds to the same element of
the member-names attribute.
