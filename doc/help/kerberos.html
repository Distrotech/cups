<H1 CLASS="title">Using Kerberos Authentication</H1>

<P>CUPS allows you to use a Key Distribution Center (KDC) for authentication on your local CUPS server and when printing to a remote authenticated queue. This document describes how to configure CUPS to use Kerberos authentication and provides links to the MIT help pages for configuring Kerberos on your systems and network.</P>


<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="REQUIREMENTS">System Requirements</A></H2>

<p>The following are required to use Kerberos with CUPS:</p>

<ol>

	<li>Heimdal Kerberos (any version) or MIT Kerberos (1.6.3 or newer)</li>

	<li>Properly configured Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure (for your servers):<ol type='a'>
		<li>DNS server(s) with static IP addresses for all CUPS servers or configured to allow DHCP updates to the host addresses and</li>
		<li>All CUPS clients and servers configured to use the same
DNS server(s).</li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>Properly configured Kerberos infrastructure:<ol type='a'>
		<li>KDC configured to allow CUPS servers to obtain Service Granting Tickets (SGTs) for the "host" service,</li>
		<li>LDAP-based user accounts - both OpenDirectory and ActiveDirectory provide this with the KDC, and</li>
		<li>CUPS clients and servers bound to the same KDC and LDAP
	server(s).</li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>A "host" Service Granting Ticket (SGT) for every CUPS server</li>

</ol>


<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="KRB5">Configuring Kerberos on Your System</A></H2>

<P>Before you can use Kerberos with CUPS, you will need to configure Kerberos on your system and setup a system as a KDC. Because this configuration is highly system and site-specific, please consult the following on-line resources provided by the creators of Kerberos at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT):</P>

	<LI><A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/macdev/KfM/Common/Documentation/faq-osx.html">Kerberos
	on OS X Frequently Asked Questions</A></LI>

</UL>

<P>The Linux Documentation Project also has a HOWTO on Kerberos:</P>

<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="CUPS">Configuring CUPS to Use Kerberos</A></H2>

<P>Once youhave configured Kerberos on your system(s), you can then enable Kerberos authentication by selecting the <tt>Negotiate</tt> authentication type. The simplest way to do this is using the <tt>cupsctl(8)</tt> command on your server(s):</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
<KBD>cupsctl DefaultAuthType=Negotiate</KBD>
</PRE>

<P>You can also enable Kerberos from the web interface by checking the <VAR>Use Kerberos Authentication</VAR> box and clicking <VAR>Change Settings</VAR>:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
http://server.example.com:631/admin
</PRE>

<P>After you have enabled Kerberos authentication, use the built-in "authenticated" policy or your own custom policies with the printers you will be sharing. See <a href="policies.html">Managing Operation Policies</a> for more information.</P>


<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="IMPLEMENT">Implementation Information</A></H2>

<P>CUPS implements Kerberos over HTTP using GSSAPI and the service name "host". Because of limitations in the HTTP GSSAPI protocol extension, only a single domain/KDC is supported for authentication. The HTTP extension is described in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4559">RFC 4559</a>.</P>

<P>When doing printing tasks that require authentication, CUPS requests single-use "tickets" from your login session to authenticate who you are. These tickets give CUPS a username of the form "user@REALM", which is then converted to just "user" for purposes of user and group checks.</P>

<P>In order to support printing to a shared printer, CUPS runs the IPP backend as the owner of the print job so it can obtain the necessary credentials.</P>
