This directory contains the message strings used by CUPS for various
languages.  Each subdirectory corresponds to a different locale, and
the cups_xx and cups_xx_YY files contain the messages for the locales
named "xx" or "xx_YY".

Each message file starts with a character set identifier, which can be
one of the following:

    us-ascii
    iso-8859-1
    iso-8859-2
    iso-8859-3
    iso-8859-4
    iso-8859-5
    iso-8859-6
    iso-8859-7
    iso-8859-8
    iso-8859-9
    utf-8

After that, all non-blank lines are treated as messages, with any
leading whitespace removed.  If a line starts with a number then the
message index is updated to the number.  Otherwise, the next message
number is used.

The message indices are defined in the include file <cups/language.h>.
The HTTP status messages use the status codes defined in <cups/http.h>.

If you would like to contribute a new message file for your locale, or
have corrections to the current ones, please send them to:

    cups-support@cups.org
