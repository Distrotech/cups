INTRODUCTION

    CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system developed by Apple
    Inc. for OS® X and other UNIX®-like operating systems.  CUPS uses the
    Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") and provides System V and Berkeley
    command-line interfaces, a web interface, and a C API to manage printers and
    print jobs.  It supports printing to both local (parallel, serial, USB) and
    networked printers, and printers can be shared from one computer to another,
    even over the Internet!

    Internally, CUPS uses PostScript Printer Description ("PPD") files to
    describe printer capabilities and features and a wide variety of generic
    and device-specific programs to convert and print many types of files.
    Sample drivers are included with CUPS to support many Dymo, EPSON, HP,
    Intellitech, OKIDATA, and Zebra printers.  Many more drivers are available
    online and (in some cases) on the driver CD-ROM that came with your printer.

    CUPS is licensed under the GNU General Public License and GNU Library
    General Public License versions 2.  See the file "LICENSE.txt" for more
    information.


READING THE DOCUMENTATION

    Once you have installed the software you can access the documentation (and
    a bunch of other stuff) online at:

	http://localhost:631/

    If you're having trouble getting that far, the documentation is located
    under the "doc/help" directory.

    Please read the documentation before asking questions.


GETTING SUPPORT AND OTHER RESOURCES

    If you have problems, READ THE DOCUMENTATION FIRST!  We also provide many
    discussion forums which are available at:

	http://www.cups.org/newsgroups.php

    See the CUPS web site at "http://www.cups.org/" for other resources.


SETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES USING YOUR WEB BROWSER

    CUPS includes a web-based administration tool that allows you to manage
    printers, classes, and jobs on your server.  Open the following URL in your
    browser to access the printer administration tools:

	http://localhost:631/admin/

    DO NOT use the hostname for your machine - it will not work with the default
    CUPS configuration.  To enable administration access on other addresses,
    check the "Allow Remote Administration" box and click on the "Change
    Settings" button.

    You will be asked for the administration password (root or any other user in
    the sys/system/root/admin/lpadmin group on your system) when performing any
    administrative function.


SETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES FROM THE COMMAND-LINE

    CUPS works best with PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files.  In a pinch
    you can also use System V style printer interface scripts.

    CUPS includes several sample PPD files you can use:

	Driver                         PPD Name
	-----------------------------  ------------------------------
	Dymo Label Printers            drv:///sample.drv/dymo.ppd
	Intellitech Intellibar         drv:///sample.drv/intelbar.ppd
	EPSON Stylus Color Series      drv:///sample.drv/stcolor.ppd
	EPSON Stylus Photo Series      drv:///sample.drv/stphoto.ppd
	EPSON Stylus New Color Series  drv:///sample.drv/stcolor2.ppd
	EPSON Stylus New Photo Series  drv:///sample.drv/stphoto2.ppd
	EPSON 9-pin Series             drv:///sample.drv/epson9.ppd
	EPSON 24-pin Series            drv:///sample.drv/epson24.ppd
	Generic PCL Laser Printer      drv:///sample.drv/generpcl.ppd
	Generic PostScript Printer     drv:///sample.drv/generic.ppd
	HP DeskJet Series              drv:///sample.drv/deskjet.ppd
	HP LaserJet Series             drv:///sample.drv/laserjet.ppd
	OKIDATA 9-Pin Series           drv:///sample.drv/okidata9.ppd
	OKIDATA 24-Pin Series          drv:///sample.drv/okidat24.ppd
	Zebra CPCL Label Printer       drv:///sample.drv/zebracpl.ppd
	Zebra EPL1 Label Printer       drv:///sample.drv/zebraep1.ppd
	Zebra EPL2 Label Printer       drv:///sample.drv/zebraep2.ppd
	Zebra ZPL Label Printer        drv:///sample.drv/zebra.ppd

    Run the "lpinfo -m" command to list the available drivers:

        lpinfo -m

    Run the "lpinfo -v" command to list the available printers:

        lpinfo -v

    Then use the correct URI to add the printer using the "lpadmin" command:

        lpadmin -p printername -E -v device-uri -m ppd-name

    Network printers typically use "socket" or "lpd" URIs:

        lpadmin -p printername -E -v socket://11.22.33.44 -m ppd-name
        lpadmin -p printername -E -v lpd://11.22.33.44/ -m ppd-name

    The sample drivers provide basic printing capabilities, but generally do not
    exercise the full potential of the printers or CUPS.  The CUPS web site
    provides links and drivers:

        http://www.cups.org/ppd.php      PPD files
	http://www.cups.org/links.php    Links to other drivers


PRINTING FILES

    CUPS provides both the System V "lp" and Berkeley "lpr" commands for
    printing:

	lp filename
	lpr filename

    Both the "lp" and "lpr" commands support printing options for the driver:

	lp -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi filename
	lpr -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi filename

    CUPS recognizes many types of images files as well as PDF, PostScript,
    HP-GL/2, and text files, so you can print those files directly rather than
    through an application.

    If you have an application that generates output specifically for your
    printer then you need to use the "-oraw" or "-l" options:

	lp -o raw filename
	lpr -l filename

    This will prevent the filters from misinterpreting your print
    file.
