.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcupsaccept\fR instructs the printing system to accept print jobs to the
specified destinations.
.LP
\fIcupsreject\fR instructs the printing system to reject print jobs to the
specified destinations. The \fI-r\fR option sets the reason for rejecting
print jobs. If not specified the reason defaults to "Reason Unknown".
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported by both \fIcupsaccept\fR and
\fIcupsreject\fR:
.TP 5
-E
.br
Forces encryption when connecting to the server.
.TP 5
-U username
.br
Sets the username that is sent when connecting to the server.
.TP 5
-h hostname[:port]
.br
Chooses an alternate server.
.TP 5
-r "reason"
.br
Sets the reason string that is shown for a printer that is
rejecting jobs.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to
contain any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".
Also, printer and class names are \fInot\fR case-sensitive.
.LP
The CUPS versions of \fIaccept\fR and \fIreject\fR may ask the
user for an access password depending on the printing system
configuration. This differs from the System V versions which
require the root user to execute these commands.
