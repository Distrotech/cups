.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIppdi\fR imports one or more PPD files into a PPD compiler source file.
Multiple languages of the same PPD file are merged into a single printer
definition to facilitate accurate changes for all localizations.
.PP
The \fI-o\fR option specifies the PPD source file to update. If the source
file does not exist, a new source file is created. Otherwise the existing
file is merged with the new PPD file(s) on the command-line. If no source
file is specified, the filename "ppdi.drv" is used.
