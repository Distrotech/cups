.SH NAME
lpc \- line printer control program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lpc
[
.I command
[
.I parameter(s)
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIlpc\fR provides limited control over printer and class queues
provided by CUPS. It can also be used to query the state of
queues.
.LP
If no command is specified on the command-line, \fRlpc\fR will
display a prompt and accept commands from the standard input.
.SH COMMANDS
The \fIlpc\fR program accepts a subset of commands accepted by
the Berkeley \fIlpc\fR program of the same name:
.TP 5
exit
.br
Exits the command interpreter.
.TP 5
help [command]
.TP 5
? [command]
.br
Displays a short help message.
.TP 5
quit
.br
Exits the command interpreter.
.TP 5
status [queue]
.br
Displays the status of one or more printer or class queues.
.SH LIMITATIONS
Since \fIlpc\fR is geared towards the Berkeley printing system,
it is impossible to use \fIlpc\fR to configure printer or class
queues provided by CUPS.  To configure printer or class queues
you must use the \fIlpadmin(8)\fR command or another
CUPS-compatible client with that functionality.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
The CUPS version of \fIlpc\fR does not implement all of the
standard Berkeley or LPRng commands.
