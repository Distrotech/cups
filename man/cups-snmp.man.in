.SH DESCRIPTION
The CUPS SNMP backend provides legacy discovery and identification of network
printers using SNMPv1. When used for discovery through the scheduler, the
backend will list all printers that respond to a broadcast SNMPv1 query with the
"public" community name. Additional queries are then sent to printers that
respond in order to determine the correct device URI, make and model, and other
information needed for printing.
.LP
In the first form, the SNMP backend is run directly by the user to look up the
device URI and other information when you have an IP address or hostname. This
can be used for programs that need to configure print queues where the user has
supplied an address but nothing else.
.LP
In the second form, the SNMP backend is run indirectly using the \fIlpinfo(8)\fR
command. The output provides all printers detected via SNMP on the configured
broadcast addresses. \fBNote\fR: no broadcast addresses are configured by
default.
.SH MIBS
The CUPS SNMP backend uses the information from the Host, Printer, and Port
Monitor MIBs along with some vendor private MIBs and intelligent port probes to
determine the correct device URI and make and model for each printer.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The SNMP backend reads the /etc/cups/snmp.conf configuration file, if
present, to set the default broadcast address, community name, and logging
level. The configuration file is documented in \fIcups-snmp.conf(5)\fR. The
DebugLevel value can be overridden using the CUPS_DEBUG_LEVEL environment
variable and the MaxRunTime value can be overridden using the CUPS_MAX_RUN_TIME
environment variable.
