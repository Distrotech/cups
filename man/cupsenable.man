.TP 5

.TP 5
-r "reason"
.br
Sets the message associated with the stopped state. If no reason is specified
then the message is set to "Reason Unknown".
.TP 5
--release
.br
Releases pending jobs for printing. Use after running \fIcupsdisable\fR with
the \fI--hold\fR option to resume printing.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to
contain any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".
Also, printer and class names are \fInot\fR case-sensitive.
.LP
The System V versions of these commands are \fIdisable\fR and
\fIenable\fR. They have been renamed to avoid conflicts with the
\fIbash(1)\fR build-in commands of the same name.
.LP
The CUPS versions of \fIdisable\fR and \fIenable\fR may ask the
user for an access password depending on the printing system
configuration.  This differs from the System V versions which
require the root user to execute these commands.
