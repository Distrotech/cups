.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIppdc\fR compiles PPDC source files into one or more PPD
files. \fBThis program is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of
CUPS.\fR
.PP
The \fI-D\fR option sets the named variable for use in the
source file. It is equivalent to using the #define directive
in the source file.
.PP
The \fI-I\fR option specifies an alternate include directory;
multiple \fI-I\fR options can be supplied to add additional
directories.
.PP
The \fI-c\fR option specifies a single message catalog file in GNU
gettext source format (filename.po) to be used for localization.
.PP
The \fI-d\fR option specifies the output directory for PPD
files. The default output directory is "ppd".
.PP
The \fI-l\fR option specifies one or more languages to use when
localizing the PPD file(s). The default language is "en"
(English). Separate multiple languages with commas, for example
"de_DE,en_UK,es_ES,es_MX,es_US,fr_CA,fr_FR,it_IT" will create PPD
files with German, UK English, Spanish (Spain, Mexico, and US),
French (France and Canada), and Italian languages in each file.
.PP
The \fI-m\fR option specifies that the output filename should be
based on the ModelName value instead of FileName or PCFilenName.
.PP
The \fI-t\fR option specifies that PPD files should be tested instead
of generated.
.PP
The \fI-v\fR option provides more verbose output, basically a
running status of which files are being loaded or written.
.PP
The \fI-z\fR option generates compressed PPD files (filename.ppd.gz).
The default is to generate uncompressed PPD files.
.PP
The \fI--cr\fR, \fI--crlf\fR, and \fI--lf\fR options specify the
line ending to use - carriage return, carriage return and line feed,
or line feed. The default is to use the line feed character alone.
