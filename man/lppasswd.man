.SH NAME
lppasswd \- add, change, or delete digest passwords.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lppasswd
[
.I username
]
.br
.B lppasswd
-a [ -g
.I groupname
]
.I username
.br
.B lppasswd
-x
.I username
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIlppasswd\fR adds, changes, or deletes passwords in the CUPS
digest password file, \fIpasswd.md5\fR. When run by a normal
user, \fIlppasswd\fR will prompt for the old and new passwords.
When run by the super-user, \fIlppasswd\fR can add new accounts
(\fI-a username\fR), change existing accounts (\fIusername\fR),
or delete accounts (\fI-x username\fR) in the digest password
file. Digest usernames do not have to match local UNIX usernames.
.SH OPTIONS
\fIlppasswd\fR supports the following options:
.TP 5
-g groupname
.br
Specifies a group other than the default system group.
.SH SECURITY ISSUES
By default, the \fIlppasswd\fR program is not installed to allow ordinary
users to change their passwords. To enable this, the \fIlppasswd\fR command
must be made setuid to root with the command:
.br
.nf
chmod u+s lppasswd
.fi
.PP
While every attempt has been made to make \fIlppasswd\fR secure against
exploits that could grant super-user privileges to unprivileged users,
paranoid system administrators may wish to use Basic authentication with
accounts managed by PAM instead.
