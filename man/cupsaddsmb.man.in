cupsaddsmb \- export printers to samba for windows clients

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcupsaddsmb\fR exports printers to the SAMBA software (version
2.2.0 or higher) for use with Windows clients. Depending on the
SAMBA configuration, you may need to provide a password to
export the printers. This program requires the Windows printer
driver files described below.

.SH OPTIONS
\fIcupsaddsmb\fR supports the following options:
.TP 5
-H samba-server
.br
Specifies the SAMBA server which defaults to the CUPS server.
.TP 5
-U samba-user[%samba-password]
.br
Specifies the SAMBA print admin username which defaults to your
current username. If the username contains a percent (%)
character, then the text following the percent is treated as the
SAMBA password to use.
.TP 5
-a
.br
Exports all known printers. Otherwise only the named printers are
exported.
.TP 5
-h cups-server[:port]
.br
Specifies a different CUPS server to use.
.TP 5
-v
.br
Specifies that verbose information should be shown. This is
useful for debugging SAMBA configuration problems.

.SH SAMBA CONFIGURATION
\fIcupsaddsmb\fR uses the new RPC-based printing support in
SAMBA 2.2.x to provide printer drivers and PPD files to Windows
client machines. In order to use this functionality, you must
first configure the SAMBA \fIsmb.conf(5)\fR file to support
printing through CUPS and provide a printer driver download
share, as follows:
.nf

    [global]
	load printers = yes
	printing = cups
	printcap name = cups

    [printers]
	comment = All Printers
	path = /var/spool/samba
	browseable = no
	public = yes
	guest ok = yes
	writable = no
	printable = yes

    [print$]
	comment = Printer Drivers
	path = /etc/samba/drivers
	browseable = yes
	guest ok = no
	read only = yes
	write list = root
.fi
.LP
This configuration assumes a FHS-compliant installation of
SAMBA; adjust the [printers] and [print$] share paths
accordingly on your system as needed.

.SH MICROSOFT POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS
The base driver for Windows 2000 and higher is the Microsoft
PostScript driver, which is available on any system running
Windows 2000 or higher in the
%WINDIR%\\SYSTEM32\\SPOOL\\DRIVERS\\W32X86\\3 folder for 32-bit
drivers and
%WINDIR%\\SYSTEM32\\SPOOL\\DRIVERS\\X64\\3 folder for 64-bit
drivers.
.LP
However, currently only Windows 2000 and higher is supported by the Microsoft
driver, so you will also need to get the Adobe driver to support
Windows 95, 98, and Me clients. The Adobe and Microsoft drivers
for Windows 2000 are identical.
.LP
Once you have extracted the driver files, copy the 32-bit drivers
to the \fI/usr/share/cups/drivers\fR directory and the 64-bit
drivers to the \fI/usr/share/cups/drivers/x64\fR directory exactly
as named below:
.nf

    [Windows 2000 and higher]
    ps5ui.dll
    pscript.hlp
    pscript.ntf
    pscript5.dll
.fi
.LP
\fBNote:\fR Unlike Windows, case is significant - make sure that
you use the lowercase filenames shown above, otherwise
\fIcupsaddsmb\fR will fail to export the drivers.

.SH ADOBE POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS 95, 98, AND ME
\fIcupsaddsmb\fR can use the Adobe PostScript printer driver for
Windows 95, 98, and ME, which are available for download from the
Adobe web site (http://www.adobe.com).
.LP
The Adobe driver does not support the page-label, job-billing, or
job-hold-until options.
.LP
Once you have installed the driver on a Windows system, copy the
following files to the \fI/usr/share/cups/drivers\fR directory
exactly as named below:
.nf

    [Windows 95, 98, and Me]
    ADFONTS.MFM
    ADOBEPS4.DRV
    ADOBEPS4.HLP
    ICONLIB.DLL
    PSMON.DLL
.fi
.LP
\fBNote:\fR Unlike Windows, case is significant - make sure that
you use the UPPERCASE filenames shown above, otherwise
\fIcupsaddsmb\fR will fail to export the drivers.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
Getting the full set of Windows driver files should be easier.
