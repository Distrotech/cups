.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIipptool\fR sends IPP requests to the specified URI and tests and/or displays the results. Each named file defines one or more requests, including the expected response status, attributes, and values. Output is either a plain text, formatted text, CSV, or XML report on the standard output, with a non-zero exit status indicating that one or more tests have failed. The file format is described in \fIipptoolfile(5)\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are recognized by \fIipptool\fR:
.TP 5
--help
Shows program help.
--stop-after-include-error
Tells \fIipptool\fR to stop if an error occurs in an included file. Normally \fIipptool\fR will continue with subsequent tests after the INCLUDE directive.
--version
Shows the version of \fIipptool\fR being used.
.TP 5
-4
Specifies that \fIipptool\fR must connect to the printer or server using IPv4.
.TP 5
-6
Specifies that \fIipptool\fR must connect to the printer or server using IPv6.
.TP 5
-C
Specifies that requests should be sent using the HTTP/1.1 "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header, which is required for conformance by all versions of IPP. The default is to use "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" for requests with attached files and "Content-Length:" for requests without attached files.
.TP 5
-E
Forces TLS encryption when connecting to the server using the HTTP "Upgrade" header.
.TP 5
-I
Specifies that \fIipptool\fR will continue past errors.
.TP 5
-L
Specifies that requests should be sent using the HTTP/1.0 "Content-Length:" header, which is required for conformance by all versions of IPP. The default is to use "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" for requests with attached files and "Content-Length:" for requests without attached files.
.TP 5
-S
Forces (dedicated) SSL encryption when connecting to the server.
.TP 5
-T seconds
Specifies a timeout for IPP requests in seconds.
.TP 5
-V version
Specifies the default IPP version to use: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, or 2.2. If not specified, version 1.1 is used.
.TP 5
-X
Specifies that XML (Apple plist) output is desired instead of the plain text report. This option is incompatible with the \fI-i\fR (interval) and \fI-n\fR (repeat-count) options.
.TP 5
-c
Specifies that CSV (comma-separated values) output is desired instead of the plain text output.
.TP 5
-d name=value
Defines the named variable.
.TP 5
-f filename
Defines the default request filename for tests.
.TP 5
-i seconds
Specifies that the (last) file should be repeated at the specified interval. This option is incompatible with the \fI-X\fR (XML plist output) option.
.TP 5
-l
Specifies that plain text output is desired.
.TP 5
-n repeat-count
Specifies that the (last) file should be repeated the specified number of times. This option is incompatible with the \fI-X\fR (XML plist output) option.
.TP 5
-t
Specifies that CUPS test report output is desired instead of the plain text output.
.TP 5
-v
Specifies that all request and response attributes should be output in CUPS test mode (\fI-t\fR). This is the default for XML output.
.SH EXIT CODE
The \fIipptool\fR program returns 0 if all tests were sucessful and 1 otherwise.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
The \fIipptool\fR program is unique to CUPS.
