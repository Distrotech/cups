.SH NAME
cups-deviced \- cups device daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cups-deviced
.I request-id limit user-id options
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcups-deviced\fR polls the backends in
\fI/usr/lib/cups/backend\fR or \fI/usr/libexec/cups/backend\fR (OS X) for a
list of available devices. It is run by \fIcupsd(8)\fR in response to a
\fICUPS-Get-Devices\fR request. The output format is an IPP
response message. The \fIrequest-id\fR argument is the request ID
from the original IPP request, typically 1. The \fIlimit\fR
argument is the limit value from the original IPP request - 0
means no limit. The \fIuser-id\fR argument is the
requesting-user-name value from the original IPP request.
Finally, the \fIoptions\fR argument is a space-delimited list of
attributes ("name=value name=value \...") that were passed in
with the request. Currently \fIcups-deviced\fR looks for the
\fIrequested-attributes\fR attribute and tailors the output
accordingly.
