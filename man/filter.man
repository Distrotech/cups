.SH NAME
filter \- cups file conversion filter interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B filter
job user title num-copies options [
.I filename
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The CUPS filter interface provides a standard method for adding support for
new document types to CUPS. Each filter is capable of converting from one
or more input formats to another format that can either be printed directly
or piped into another filter to get it to a printable format.
.LP
Filters \fBmust\fR be capable of reading from a filename on the command-line
or from the standard input, copying the standard input to a temporary
file as required by the file format. All output \fBmust\fR be sent to the
standard output.
.LP
The command name (argv[0]) is set to the name of the destination printer but is
also available in the PRINTER environment variable.
.SH WARNING
CUPS filters are not meant to be run directly by the user. Aside from the legacy
System V interface issues (argv[0] is the printer name), CUPS filters also
expect specific environment variables and file descriptors, and typically run in
a user session that (on OS X) has additional restrictions that affect how it
runs. Unless you are a developer and know what you are doing, please do not run
filters directly. Instead, use the \fIcupsfilter(8)\fR program to use the
appropriate filters to do the conversions you need.
.SH OPTIONS
Options passed on the command-line typically do not include the default choices
the printer's PPD file. In addition, some options may be specified in multiple
ways - "landscape" is a synonym for "orientation-requested=4", "media" is a
synonym for "PageSize", "PageRegion", "InputSlot", and "MediaType", and "sides"
is a synonym for the various "Duplex" options. Non-raster filters \fBmust\fR
support both explicit and implicit specification of PPD options - use the
ppdMarkDefaults and cupsMarkOptions functions in the CUPS library to use the
correct mapping, and ppdFindMarkedChoice to get the user-selected choice.
.LP
Raster filters should use option choices set through the raster page header, as
those reflect the options in effect for a given page. Options specified on the
command-line determine the default values for the entire job, which can be
overridden on a per-page basis.
.SH LOG MESSAGES
Messages sent to stderr are generally logged to
printer-state-message attribute and the current \fIErrorLog\fR.
Each line begins with a standard prefix:
.TP 5
ALERT: message
.br
Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified
message to the current \fIErrorLog\fR using the "alert" log level.
.TP 5
ATTR: attribute=value [attribute=value]
.br
Sets the named job or printer attribute(s). The following job attributes can be
set: "job-media-progress". The following printer attributes can be set:
"auth-info-required", "marker-colors", "marker-high-levels", "marker-levels",
"marker-low-levels", "marker-message", "marker-names", "marker-types",
"printer-alert", and "printer-alert-description".
.TP 5
CRIT: message
.br
Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified
message to the current \fIErrorLog\fR using the "critical" log level.
.TP 5
DEBUG: message
.br
Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified
message to the current \fIErrorLog\fR using the "debug" log level.
.TP 5
DEBUG2: message
.br
Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified
message to the current \fIErrorLog\fR using the "debug2" log level.
.TP 5
EMERG: message
.br
Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified
message to the current \fIErrorLog\fR using the "emergency" log level.
.TP 5
ERROR: message
.br
Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified
message to the current \fIErrorLog\fR using the "error" log level.
.TP 5
INFO: message
.br
Sets the printer-state-message attribute. If the current \fILogLevel\fR
is set to "debug2", also adds the specified message to the
current \fIErrorLog\fR using the "info" log level.
.TP 5
NOTICE: message
.br
Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified
message to the current \fIErrorLog\fR using the "notice" log level.
.TP 5
PAGE: page-number #-copies
.TP 5
PAGE: total #-pages
.br
Adds an entry to the current \fIPageLog\fR. The first form adds
#-copies to the job-media-sheets-completed attribute. The second
form sets the job-media-sheets-completed attribute to #-pages.
.TP 5
PPD: Keyword=Value ... KeywordN=Value
.br
Sets the named keywords in the printer's PPD file. This is typically
used to update default option keywords such as DefaultPageSize and
the various installable options in the PPD file.
.TP 5
STATE: printer-state-reason [printer-state-reason ...]
.TP 5
STATE: + printer-state-reason [printer-state-reason ...]
.TP 5
STATE: - printer-state-reason [printer-state-reason ...]
.br
Sets, adds, or removes printer-state-reason keywords to the
current queue. Typically this is used to indicate media, ink, and
toner conditions on a printer.
.TP 5
WARNING: message
.br
Sets the printer-state-message attribute and adds the specified
message to the current \fIErrorLog\fR using the "warning" log level.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables are defined by the CUPS
server when executing the filter:
.TP 5
CHARSET
.br
The default text character set, typically utf-8.
.TP 5

When a job is submitted to a printer class, contains the name of
the destination printer class. Otherwise this environment
variable will not be set.
.TP 5

only filter.  Typically the interface script will be provided via the
\fIlpadmin(8)\fR command using the \fI-i\fR option.
